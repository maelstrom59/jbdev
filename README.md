Jupiter Dev
=============

Collaboration project for Jupiter Broadcasting development, a repository for the site and for design documents/goals.

* The current spec can be viewed [here](https://github.com/rikai/jbdev/blob/master/SPEC.md).

Notes
=====
Both active branches welcome merge requests that make sense. @rikai and @ChrisLAS have final say on merges.

* The master branch will contain API, style, content, requests and any other relevant documents to help focus the direction of JB, as this is a community effort.
* The gh-pages branch contains the jbdeval site, and is where pull requests for changes to the site should be filed.
